    <div class="bio">
      Graduated with a Bachelor&apos;s in Computer Engineering from Illinois Institute of
      Technology, where I found my love for everything Technology. As soon as I graduated, I
      joined SAP Next Talent Program which is a rotational program where I got to expand my
      knowledge in Front End Development. From the SNT program I joined SAP Success Factors as a
      UI Engineer.

        <h3>SAP SuccessFactors - Present</h3>
        <p>
          During my time at SNT I was interviewing with other teams within SAP, with my luck I interviewed with SuccessFactors WEF team. 
          This is a fantastic team which works on multiple projects both on the cutting edge and legacy. I was asked to 
          be the Scrum Master from the start for a specific product which was daunting nevertheless being a new team
           member. I was able to work on so many aspects many products from developing new UI components, fixing defects, 
           raising code coverage, implementing API contracts, and being the QA for others. I am still at the beginning of my 
           career, and I know there is still so much to learn.

        <h3>Supplier Management - May, 2022</h3>
        <p>
          As you can guess my second rotation in the SNT program was Supplier Management. This team was a more established 
          product unlike the previous rotation. During this rotation the bulk of my work was to fix the accessibility issues 
          that had been reported by the Quality Assurance team. To fix all the issues that were reported it was estimated that 
          it would be a two-year project. By the end of my time at SM I was able to finish over 20% of all Accessibility 
          issues. During my time at SM, I was able to learn quite a bit about how important Accessibility is within a product. 
          I also volunteered to be on call in case there was any issue with servers Ariba had in development.

        <h3>Brilliant Hire - June, 2021</h3>
        <p>
          The first job out of college I was fortunate enough to get into a rotational program called SAP Next Talent 
          in which I would be able to do three six-month long rotations. Luckily for me the first rotation I did was for 
          Brilliant Hire which is a part of SAP.io program. In layman&apos;s terms Brilliant Hire was a startup within SAP 
          whose focus was to use AI to show potential appliers the best jobs for them to apply to. During my time 
          at Brilliant Hire, I worked as a Full Stack developer using Vue on the Front End and Nodejs on the backend. 
          I was able to learn so much from everybody in the team, not only developers but as well as the team members 
          in charge of selling the product. This was valuable information since they helped me communicate more effectively 
          with people who were not involved in the technical details.

        <h3>American Airlines - January, 2020</h3>
        <p>
          This was the first job in which I was going to be able to use programming as a tool in the real 
          world, to say I was excited for this opportunity is an understatement. During my time at American 
          Airlines the main project in which I oversaw the development of was an airplane engine configuration 
          application. Airplane engines as you can imagine are composed of many different parts which can 
          possibly be interchanged with other engines. When a part of an engine needed to be replaced a 
          team was needed to find which available part can be used. The team in charge of this configuration 
          took about 4 hours to complete this task. Once I was done with the application they used it and where 
          able to complete the configuration in about 5 minutes.
